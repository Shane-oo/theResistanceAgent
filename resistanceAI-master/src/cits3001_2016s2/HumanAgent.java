/**
 * A Java class for a human to play Resistance.
 * Each agent is given a single capital letter, which will be their name for the game.
 * The game actions will be encoded using strings.
 * The agent will be created entirely in a single game, and the agent must maintain its own state.
 * Methods will be used for informing agents of game events (get_ methods, must return in 100ms) or requiring actions (do_ methods, must return in 1000ms).
 * If actions do not meet the required specification, a nominated default action will be recorded.
